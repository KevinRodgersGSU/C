Additional Requirements
1.	A function that calculate average tuition of the 10 universities using  recursion manner.
1.1.	It means that you need to declare a sum function, and that function needs to calculate the sum by calling itself.
1.2.	The result then can be divided by 10 to get the result.
2.	Implement a function that will sort the rank of the universities from low to high using a O(n*log(n)) complexity. The most popular sort with this complexity is merge sort or quick sort.
